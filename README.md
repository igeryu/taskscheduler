# Single-Threaded OS Scheduler Simulator

This application simulates a single-threaded operating system, in either FCFS (First come, first served) or SJF (shortest job first) scheduling.  The simulator has only two shared resources, the CPU and the I/O, both used for CPU- and I/O-bursts, respectively.
